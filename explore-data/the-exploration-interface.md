# The Exploration Interface

Cellxgene's user interface organizes single cell data similarly to how it is organized in commonly used single cell data formats. On the left-hand side, you can find information about categorical sample metadata \(observations\). The right hand sidebar contains information about continuous observational metadata and variable metadata \(usually genes\). Finally in the center, you can find the embedding scatterplot, which displays each cell as a point.

The cellxgene toolbar buttons provide the following functionalities:

1. **Subset** the cells based on current selection \(based on categorical, numerical, or manual\). Only active when a selection is active.
2. **Reset to Whole**. Get the complete set of cells. Only active when a subset is currently active.
3. **Lasso** selection of cells on the plot \(manual selection\).
4. **Zoom** and move embedding plot.
5. **Display category names** of a selected categorical metadata field over the embedding.
6. **Clip outlier** values.
7. **Undo**.
8. **Redo**.
