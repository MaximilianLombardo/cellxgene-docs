# The Exploration Interface

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2819%29.png)

Cellxgene's user interface organizes single cell data similarly to how it is organized in commonly used single cell data formats. On the left-hand side, you can find information about categorical sample metadata \(observations\). The right hand sidebar contains information about continuous observational metadata and variable metadata \(i.e. expression\). Finally in the center, you can find the embedding scatterplot displaying the data.

Important icons and functionalities in cellxgene's user interface are displayed above. Below are the buttons and functionalities that are located in the toolbar.

The cellxgene toolbar buttons provide the following functionalities:

1. Subsets the cells based on current selection \(based on categorical, numerical, or manual\). Only active when a selection is active
2. Get the complete set of cells. Only active when a subset is currently active
3. Lasso selection of cells on the plot \(manual selection\)
4. Zoom and move embedding plot
5. When the cells are colored by a categorical metadata field, this button allows the display of values of in that field displayed over the appropriate group of cells \(i.e. when coloring by "cell type", cell type names are displayed over the medoid of the cluster\)
6. Clip outlier values \(used for plotting continuous metadata when color map is thrown off by outliers\)
7. Undo
8. Redo
