## Interactive demos

Several groups have independently [deployed](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene/blob/main/docs/posts/hosted) various versions of cellxgene to the web. Check out the cool data that our users are using cellxgene to explore!

### [Kidney cell atlas](https://www.kidneycellatlas.org/)

### [Tabula muris senis](https://tabula-muris-senis.ds.czbiohub.org/)

### [Hemocytes](https://hemocytes.cellgeni.sanger.ac.uk/)

### [Melanoma](https://melanoma.cellgeni.sanger.ac.uk/)
