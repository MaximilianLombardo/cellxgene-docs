### Cross-filter cells and color by metadata

Categorical metadata can be used not only to color cells in the embedding scatterplot, but also to examine the representation of a particular metadata across other metadata fields. In the example below, check out how we can:

1. Select all the cells that have the value "marrow" in the tissue category
2. Subset these cells so that only they are displayed
3. Expand another metadata category \("subtissue"\) to reveal how cells from the marrow are distributed across different sub-tissues

### Compare groups of cells with differential expression

Differential expression can be run between selections of two different groups of cells. In the media below, these steps are to:

1. Select cells for the first group \("B Cells"\)
2. Select cells for the second group \("granulocytes"\)
3. Click the differential expression icon \( ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png) \)
4. The top 10 differentially expressed features will appear on the right hand side-bar
