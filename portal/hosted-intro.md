# Intro to Portal and Publishing

### About

The [cellxgene data portal](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) is a single cell publishing platform that is optimized for the access, exploration, and reuse of single cell data. The data portal currently accepts high impact datasets that are standardized according to [succinctly defined data schema](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/main/docs/corpora_schema.md). In addition to providing a standardized data corpus, the cellxgene data portal offers the following benefits:

* link permanence \(you can reference in your publication without ever worrying about dead links\)
* sharing of private datasets with collaborators \(keep the data private until it is ready for publication\)
* no barrier for readers to explore your dataset \(and no need for you to build your own single cell data explorer\)
* availability of datasets in the major single cell data formats \(including `AnnData`, `seurat`, and `loom`\)

### Use Cases

Data portal is a logical choice for the following tasks:

* Searching a standardized data corpus to find relevant single cell datasets and downloading for reuse
* Showcasing data from a publication and allowing readers to interact with data 
* Comparison and basic integration across single cell datasets \(future\)

To find out about more things that you can do with the hosted explorer, you can refer to our [section on explorer features](../explorer/feature-overview/)!

### Portal Features

* Download datasets in commonly used single cell data formats \(direct download or curl links provided\)
* hosted explorer
* Download gene sets
* Where's My Gene
* API

### History

The platform itself evolved from a cellxgene based system \(the [COVID-19 data portal\)](https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/) that was developed to host single cell datasets related to COVD-19 in the face of the 2020 global pandemic. Since then, the cellxgene team has reacted to the need for a more generalized system that could increase access to single cell data and subsequently increase the velocity of biomedical research.
