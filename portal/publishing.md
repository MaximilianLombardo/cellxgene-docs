# Publishing

One of the main draws of the [cellxgene data portal](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) is a standardized data corpus that removes the friction of finding and reusing single cell datasets that are relevant to your research. Standardization of a single cell dataset occurs via the application of a standardized data schema which captures key metadata about the dataset and observations \(cells\) within the dataset. These metadata are used within our database to provide advanced searching of datasets at the cellular level.

To get an overview of the curation process, you can refer to the following [tutorial](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/tutorial-prototype/docs/curation-proto-tut.md). For an in-depth read look at how our data schema is defined, you can refer to this [document](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/main/docs/corpora_schema.md). For a description of how schema information is encoded into your `AnnData` object,  you can refer to this [document](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/ambrosecarr/schema-v1.1.1/schema/1.1.1/anndata_encoding.md)
