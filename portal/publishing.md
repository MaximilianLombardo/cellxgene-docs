# Upload and Publish Data

{% hint style="info" %}
We are currently alpha testing the publishing portal and are not accepting public submissions at this time. However, if you have a dataset and are interested in helping us test upload and other portal features please reach out to [cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com](mailto:cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com) and we'll be happy to discuss whether your dataset is something that we can accept.
{% endhint %}

## Why Submit Data to the Data Portal?

The Data Portal is designed to maximize the impact of your published data by maximizing their accessibility and reusability through graphical tools and command line interfaces:

| Major single cell data reuse case | Data Portal feature |
| :--- | :--- |
| Computational Benchmarking | [Standardized data](data-portal.md#downloading-data) in R and Python native formats |
| Meta Analysis / Integrative Analysis | [Standardized data](data-portal.md#downloading-data) in R and Python native formats |
| Evaluate published results | Instant data exploration in [Cellxgene Explorer](../explore-data/the-exploration-interface.md) |
| Gene Lookup \(by cell type, or other entity\) | Add gene in Cellxgene Explorer and paint by cell types |
| Biological Pathway Exploration | Add gene set in Cellxgene Explorer and paint by any metadata |

The Data Portal also provides features that assist in the Publication process:

* **Citation:** the portal provides permanent publication links that can be cited in your paper or preprint and linked to from your lab's website. 
* **Private Collaboration:** Data uploaded to the portal can be kept private until you are ready to publish it, and private links can be shared with collaborators or manuscript reviewers.

If you wish to contribute your data to the Data Portal it will need to be formatted to adhere to the [the single-cell annotated data schema](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/main/schema/2.0.0/corpora_schema.md). Documentation describing how to format and submit data is available in the [single-cell-curation](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation) repository.
