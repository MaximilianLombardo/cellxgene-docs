# Intro to Cellxgene Desktop

Cellxgene Desktop is the version of cellxgene that should be used in cases where data is stored locally or in a self-hosted situation. It is launched via the command line with a reference to the local path of a properly formatted `AnnData` object. It is an appropriate choice for the following use cases:

* Data is proprietary or highly sensitive
* Collaborative use \(necessitating need of annotations feature\)

Besides the annotations feature, another distinguishing feature of cellxgene desktop is to be able to recompute a new embedding based on a selection of cells. For a more complete feature description and descriptions of how to execute them in cellxgene, refer to our [explorer documentation](../explorer/feature-overview/).
